# How to set up custom payload

The following is a set of guidelines for setting up the payload proposed in the paper [Lowering Barriers to Entry for Fully-Integrated Custom Payloads on a DJI Matrice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06176): https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06176.

## Overview

We propose a top-mounted, generic computational payload intended to be cheap and customizable. It uses the E-port for accessing the drone's camera feeds, sensors and data topics, and for controlling the drone's flight and the behavior of other payloads. It uses the PSDK port for streaming video to the controller using the drone's transmission infrastructure, so that an operator can see a custom visualization in real time without adding transmission equipment to the drone. Currently, this requires two PSDK applications to be running simultaneously -- one for each port. DJI may of course change this in the future. However, since the applications are not interconnected, one such application can be run on its own if the functionality of one of the ports is not required. This demo runs the DJI E-port demo code (accesses camera feeds, sensor data, controls flight and other payloads), and a custom application to stream the desktop of the Raspberry Pi to the controller. Finally, the payload fits in a 3D-printed case with quick-release brackets for convenient and quick installation in the field.

## Physical setup

For creating the 3D-printed parts, see the Thingiverse entry here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6681945.

We are using the following electronics:
* **Raspberry PI 5:** the whole reason for the existence of this payload -- a Linux computational environment that provides access to the drone.
* **E-port expansion board:** an interface providing USB-C access to the drone via its E-port (https://store.dji.com/product/dji-e-port-development-kit?vid=141171)
* **SkyPort V2 expansion board:** an interface providing ethernet access to the drone via its PSDK port -- and implicitly via an upward gimbal connector. (https://store.dji.com/product/psdk-development-kit-v2?vid=89481, https://store.dji.com/product/m300-upward-gimbal-connector?vid=100911)
* **DFR0753 DC-to-DC converter:** a power supply unit that can provide a more reliable 5V source to the Raspberry Pi than the expansion boards can.

### Power
The Raspberry Pi 5 can consume 5A at 5V, which is a lot to keep up with. Although the E-port board provides a 5V source, it is unable to power the Pi at full speed according to our tests. Therefore, we instead pull from the E-port's 12V source, stepping down to 5V with the DFR0753, which is more reliable. We connect the output of the DFR0753 to the Raspberry Pi's 5V and GND GPIO pins. This is the only connection that is explicitly for power on this setup.

### Data
We connect the USB-C connector on the E-port board to the Raspberry Pi's main USB-C connector. This provides power and data to the Pi. We transfer data using 2 bulk devices configured over this single USB link (explained later). It is possible to use Ethernet over USB, but this interferes with the SkyPort V2 expansion board, which requires Ethernet. Further, fewer data sources are available over the Ethernet over USB link, e.g., the drone's onboard depth cameras.

We connect the Ethernet port on the SkyPort V2 expansion board to the Raspberry Pi's Ethernet port. The SkyPort V2 expansion board connects to the SkyPort V2 connector using its included cable, and the SkyPort V2 connector connects to an upward gimbal connector, which connects to the drone's PSDK port. We have disassembled the upward gimbal connector and the SkyPort V2 connector and reassembled them using a low-profile 3D printed assembler that allows the pieces to fit inside the payload case. We do not draw power from the SkyPort V2 expansion board.

## What is the DJI Payload SDK?

The DJI Payload SDK(PSDK), is a development kit provided by DJI to support developers to develop payload that can be
mounted on DJI drones. Combined with the X-Port, SkyPort or extension port adapter, developers can obtain the
information or other resource from the drone. According to the software logic and algorithm framework designed by the
developer, users could develop payload that can be mounted on DJI Drone, to perform actions they need, such as Automated
Flight Controller, Payload Controller, Video Image Analysis Platform, Mapping Camera, Megaphone And Searchlight, etc.
